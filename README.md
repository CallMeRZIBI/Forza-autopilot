"# Forza-autopilot" 

Take this as some form of my continuing with the old forgotten Minecraft bot but just better XDD

I'm making this for forza cause minecraft is lame on cars (forzas physics sometimes isn't the best but it's just better)
I'm going to use TensorFlow instead of my own NN rewriten from Daniel Shiffman to c#,
and all of this will be in Python and not in c# cause it's bot and not some hacks :DDDD

Also I got hugely inspired by Charles 2.0
